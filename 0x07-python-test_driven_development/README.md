Python- Test-driven development:

TDD - A software development strategy or procedure where tests are written/conducted based on the software requirements.
These tests are done before the software is fully developed i.e Do the the test, if test fails implement code, conduct test again,
if test does not fail continue development.

The cycle/process:

1. Write a test.

2. Run the test - see if the test fails.

3. Write the code - Just enough to pass the test.

4. Run the test again - If it still fails, go back to number 3.

5. Refactor the code - Once the test passes code can be improved, if needs be ensuring the test still passes.

6. Repeat.
